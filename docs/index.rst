Welcome to GIO Land's documentation!
====================================

GIO land HRLs are produced by Service Providers over 39 countries. There
are HRLs for 5 main themes:

* Imperviousness
* Forest
* Grasslands
* Wetland
* Water

Each HRL goes through verification and enhancement procedures. This
entails several processes, which are the responsibilities of different
stakeholders, including the 39 National Reference Centres and the
European Topic Centre for Spatial Information and Analysis.

At each stage, HRL data and reports are transferred between stakeholders
using internet protocols. The Verification and Enhancement portal
performs these transfers, and provides a mechanism for monitoring the
production status of GIO land HRL deliveries.
