HRL Verification and Enhancement Documentation
==============================================


Purpose and concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Verification and Enhancement portal is a web platform for the transfer of HRL data and reports, using internet protocols, between stakeholders throughout the Verification and Enhancement stages of production. It also provides a mechanism for monitoring the workflows and production status of HRL deliveries.

HRLs covering 39 countries are produced by Service Providers. There are HRLs for 6 themes:

* Imperviousness Density
* Forest Type
* Forest Density
* Grasslands
* Wetland
* Water

Each HRL goes through verification and enhancement procedures. This entails several processes, which are the responsibilities of different stakeholders, including the 39 National Reference Centres and the European Topic Centre for Spatial Information and Analysis. With this number of production processes, and this number of stakeholders, it was necessary to develop a system to manage the data transfers, to monitor the work flows and to provide workflow-triggered notifications to stakeholders.
