HRL 2015 reference year - production platform documentation
===========================================================


Purpose and concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 2015 reference year HRL production platform is a web platform for the transfer of HRL data and reports, using internet protocols, between stakeholders throughout the production of the HRL production for the 2015 reference year. It also provides a mechanism for monitoring the workflows and production status of HRL deliveries.
HRLs are produced by service providers as European projection mosaics, covering the whole of the EEA39 area. The work is split in 5 lots, corresponding to 5 HRL themes (often with various products per theme):

* Imperviousness
* Forest
* Grasslands
* Wetness and Water
* Small woody features (SWF)

The main products of all HRLs go through a technical (semantic) check, and through a validation (for selected samples of initial products). This entails several processes, which are the responsibilities of different stakeholders, including the service providers, EEA and ETC ULS. With such a complex workflow, it was necessary to develop a system to manage the data transfers, to monitor the work flows and to provide workflow-triggered notifications to stakeholders.
